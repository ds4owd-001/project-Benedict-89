## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:

    Comprehensive borehole drilling using state-of-the-art equipment, documenting parameters      such as depth, static water level, and aquifer material, followed by precise post-drilling     measurements.


2.  Methods for processing the data:
    
    Utilized advanced statistical techniques including regression, correlation, and time          series analysis to interpret hydrogeological data and discern patterns, trends, and           relationships.

3.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the
    data: 
    
    State-of-the-art drilling equipment (drilling rig) employed for borehole drilling;            advanced statistical methods such as regression analysis, correlation analysis, and time      series analysis and R-programming used for data analysis and interpretation.

4.  Standards and calibration information, if appropriate:
    
    Followed best practices in hydrogeological research, using high-tech drilling equipment       designed for minimal disturbance and ensuring precision in measurement techniques.

5.  Environmental/experimental conditions:
    
    Data collection spanned from January 1, 2001, to March 1, 2001, capturing seasonal            variations in groundwater levels and facilitating a nuanced understanding of temporal         dynamics.

6.  Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:

    Meticulous logging of borehole materials and geological analysis performed to ensure          accurate data collection; pumping tests conducted systematically to assess hydrogeological     parameters.

7.  People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or
    submission:
    
    Experienced team involved in all phases, from site selection to drilling operations, data     collection, and analysis, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the hydrogeological        dataset.
